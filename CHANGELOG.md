## [0.8.9] - 2025-10-01

### üéØ **MAJOR: MPV Support Removed - VLC Exclusive**

After comprehensive architecture analysis, **MPV support has been completely removed** from PiSignage. This decision was made after discovering that MPV was 90% non-functional and would require 36+ hours of development to implement properly.

#### Reasons for Removal
1. **MPV was critically broken:**
   - ‚ùå No playback controls (play/pause/stop/next/prev)
   - ‚ùå No volume control
   - ‚ùå No status monitoring
   - ‚ùå No screenshot integration
   - ‚ùå No IPC/socket communication implemented

2. **VLC is superior for digital signage:**
   - ‚úÖ Mature HTTP API with full control
   - ‚úÖ Real-time status via JSON
   - ‚úÖ Screenshot via FFmpeg extraction
   - ‚úÖ Battle-tested on Raspberry Pi
   - ‚úÖ Already fully integrated

3. **Code quality:**
   - Removed 400+ lines of broken/untested code
   - Simplified codebase (1 player instead of 2)
   - Reduced maintenance burden
   - Prevented user confusion

#### Changes Made

**Backend (API):**
- `api/player.php`: Completely refactored to use VLCController exclusively
  - Removed hardcoded MPV `pkill` and `mpv` shell commands
  - All actions now route through VLCController class
  - Proper error handling and response messages
- `api/system.php`: Updated `getCurrentPlayer()` to always return 'vlc'
  - Removed reference to non-existent `unified-player-control.sh`
  - Simplified player status detection

**Frontend (UI):**
- `dashboard.php`: Removed player switcher UI (radio buttons for VLC/MPV)
  - Replaced with informational display: "Lecteur: VLC Media Player"
- `dashboard.js`: Disabled `switchPlayer()` function
  - Shows info message: "PiSignage utilise VLC exclusivement"
  - `getCurrentPlayer()` always returns 'vlc'

**Configuration:**
- `includes/auth.php`: Updated version to 0.8.9
- Added changelog note about MPV removal

**Infrastructure:**
- Fixed nginx configuration to support REST API PATH_INFO (from v0.8.8)
  - Resolves DELETE/PATCH requests for schedule API
  - Prevents 302 redirects to dashboard.php

#### Migration Notes

**No action required** for existing users - VLC was already the default and recommended player. If you were using MPV, it will automatically fall back to VLC.

#### Documentation

See `/opt/pisignage/docs/MPV-VLC.md` for complete technical analysis including:
- Feature-by-feature compatibility matrix
- Architectural assessment
- Effort estimates for full MPV implementation
- Decision justification
